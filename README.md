cisc 3665 | game design
===============

I use this repo to keep track of my assignments completed (and currently working on) for Professor Xiang's Game Design CISC 3665 course that I am currently enrolled in at CUNY Brooklyn College.

All of the work is done in [Processing](http://processing.org/) and I have posted the assignment sheets that detail what is required for each lab.

Lab 1 : Image Processing + Drawing Curves
===============

This lab consisted of two parts: Image Processing and Drawing Curves

- Learn how to access the individual pixels of an image in Processing and extrapolate useful information from them. The program will show an image of a smiley face. Press 'r', 'g', or 'b' to see red, green, or blue tints of the image, respectively. Press 'a' to see the average color of the image and 'o' to return to the original image.
- Learn about drawing the two different types of curves -- spline curves and bezier curves -- and see their differences while using the same start, end, and control points. Pressing any key will toggle between the two curves.


Lab 2 : Tileworld
===============

Using a preexisting tileworld code consisting of an agent, obstacles, tiles, and holes, flesh out the functionality of the world by giving the agent *some* intelligence. Prevent the agent from travelling into an obstacle. If the agent falls into a hole, then it is game over. But, if the agent pushes a tile into a hole, it should receive $1. The agent acts *mostly* randomly, and does not try and win the game in any meaningful way.
